2. How to add images on input element
```input-element{ background-image: url(path); background-position: x y; background-size: value;}```
> This method is more efficient as it lets me set both size and position of icon INSISDE the input element


4. How to run function from input text using ```enter``` button on keyboard only
```input.addEventListener("keyup", (e)=>{ if e.keyCode === 13{(e.target.value)}}) ;```

where ```(e)``` is the key from keyboard and the if statement checks for specific key from keyboard using keyCodes
